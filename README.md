# Creating a random forest model using scikit-learn and predicting AQI values based on lastweek aqi values.

## The plane is:
### The model predicts next weeks aqi based on last weeks aqi and is scored based on its predictions.

#### Note: aqi_slow model is trained on AQI_PNQ.csv, which scored extremely bad. the other model is the better model(by my standard of knowledge).

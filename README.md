# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

## Project Description:
This project focuses on predicting the next dayâ€™s Air Quality Index (AQI) using historical pollutant measurements. The dataset contains hourly readings of pollutants like CO, NH3, NO2, OZONE, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2, which are aggregated to daily averages for modeling.
A Random Forest Regressor is used to capture nonlinear relationships between pollutant levels and AQI. The model is trained on features including pollutant concentrations and temporal attributes such as month and weekday.
